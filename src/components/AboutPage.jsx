    <h3>I am Richard Leung</h3>
    <p>Full stack developer at unemployment ville. Not a joke. I&apos;m seriously unemployed and will be updating this once I&apos;m not-hopefully in the near future. 
      I love spending time reading Sci-fi novels, optimizing the small details and learning new things! 
      I also enjoy working in teams and pride myself on my communication skills.</p>
